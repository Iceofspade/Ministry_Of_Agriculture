`COLOR SCHEME`

Color scheme selection was done so by assessing not only the colors used on the previous version of the site but also sites with 
similar natue and then it was taken into consideration what they all lacked as it relates to the focus of the site. As agriculture is an 
earth focused area it was decide to use warm earth tone colors so that the site may convey the feeling of those interested in agriculture.
Also the color scheme of the island/governing body also played a significant role in coloring the webpage.
